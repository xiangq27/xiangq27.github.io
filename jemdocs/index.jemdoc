== About me
I am a faculty member in the [https://cs.xmu.edu.cn/ Department of Computer Science] at [https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/ School of Informatics], [https://www.xmu.edu.cn/ Xiamen University], where I lead the [https://sngroup.org.cn/ System and Networking Group (SNGroup)]. Before joining XMU, I was a faculty in the [https://cpsc.yale.edu/ Department of Computer Science] at [https://www.yale.edu/ Yale University] and the [https://cpsc.yale.edu/ School of Computer Science] at [https://www.mcgill.ca/ McGill University], respectively. I received my Master and PhD Degrees from the [https://engineering.wayne.edu/computer-science Department of Computer Science] at [https://wayne.edu/ Wayne State University] in 2012 and 2014, respectively, under the supervision of [https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~hongwei/ Dr. Hongwei Zhang]. I received my Bachelor Degree in Information Security and Bachelor Degree in Economics from [https://www.nankai.edu.cn/ Nankai University] in 2007.

== Research Interests
My research focuses on building reliable, high-performance and secure large-scale networks and systems, including but not limited to data center networks, wide-area networks, cyber-physical systems and machine learning systems. I publish in top-tier system conferences (e.g., SIGCOMM, OSDI, FAST, SC, and INFOCOM) and journals (e.g., ToN, JSAC, and TMC). My work has been deployed or adopted by multiple academic organizations and industry partners.

== Prospective Students
I am looking for self-motivated graduate students on both Master and Ph.D. levels. If you are interested in working on exciting projects on computer networks and systems, please drop me an email.
