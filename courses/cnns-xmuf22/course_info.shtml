    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>The Internet has grown from a research curiosity to something
    as essential as the ubiquitous telephone and utility networks. It
    has been able to withstand rapid growth fairly well and its core
    protocols have been robust enough to accommodate applications
    (e.g., the World Wide Web) that were unforeseen by the original
    Internet designers. Networking is becoming an essential component
    of many systems. </p>

    <p>In this class, we will study the design, implementation,
    analysis, and evaluation of this global network. We will start
    with the design principles and the architecture of this global
    network infrastructure. We will follow the seven layers
    architecture and study the major protocols in detail. Through both
    analysis and programming assignments, the students will learn how
    the Internet works and how to design Internet applications. </p>

    <p>Topics include: layered network architectures, applications,
    transport, congestion, routing, data link protocols, local area
    networks, performance analysis, cloud networking, multimedia 
    networking, and network security. An emphasis will be placed 
    on the protocols used in the Internet. </p> 

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3> 

    <p>This will be a fast-paced course that covers both the
    algorithmic/theoretical background and the practical programming
    for computer networks. Basic knowledge of distributed computing and probability
    will be helpful but not required. Background
    in operating system will be helpful for some programming
    assignments.
    <!--The algorithmic background required is
    covered in <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs223/">CPSC
    223b</a>. Basic knowledge of distributed computing and probability
    will be helpful but not required. The practical programming
    background required is covered in CPSC 223b and <a
    href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs323/">323a</a>.  Background
    in operating system will be helpful for some programming
    assignments. The prerequisite is CPSC 323a, for which CPSC 223b is
    a prerequisite.--> 
    </p> 

    <h3>Course requirements</h3>

    </ul>
    <p><b>Class participation.</b> If you do not ask questions in
      the class, you will not get as much out of the class as you could.
      Your class participation will be based on the instructor's
      assessment of whether you are regularly involved in the class over
      the course of the semester. If at the end of the semester the
      instructor cannot remember you, you have not actively participated
      in the class. </p>
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>I strongly encourage you to discuss any topic with anyone. That's
      the way good science happens. As a professional, you should
      acknowledge any significant discussions in your homework/projects.
      However, when the time comes to write the homework or program,
      such discussions are no longer appropriate---the solution or
      program must be your own personal inspiration (although you may
      ask the instructor and teaching fellow for help in writing and
      debugging). DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COPY ANOTHER PERSON'S
      HOMEWORK OR PROGRAM---to do so is a clear violation of
      ethical/academic standards that, when discovered, will be referred
      to the university for disciplinary action. </p>
    <h3>Late homework policy</h3>
    <p>A lab assignment or  that is not completed by the time specified
      in the assignment (and whose late submission is not authorized by
      the instructor or by a Dean's excuse) will be <b> <i>not</i></b>
      be graded. </p>
