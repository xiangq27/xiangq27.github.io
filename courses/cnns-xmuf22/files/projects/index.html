    <h2>Computer Networks and Network Security: Class Projects</h2>

    <p align="left">The following is a list of suggested project topics. Each
    team should consists of 2-4 students. This list will be updated with new
    topics as well as a short description in the next couple of weeks.
    <b>Please talk to the instructor to get the approval on team
    and project topic.</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Exploring Secure Multi-Party Computation</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li><b>Designing Fast Incremental Data Plane Verification</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li><b>Capturing Causal-Relationship in Routing Protocols</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li><b>Accelerating Problem Solving Using Programmable Switches</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li><b>Measurement Study of Congestion Control</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      In class, we teach the basics of congestion control algorithms and analyze
      their performances analytically. 
      In this project, you will learn how to use ns3, a state-of-the-art network
      simulator, to simulate different congestion control algorithms (e.g., TCP
      Reno and DCTCP) under different settings of topologies, traffic patterns
      and switch/router specifications. Your goal is to (1) conduct
      comprehensive measurement study to identify the issues of different
      congestion control algorithms, (2) design and implement your own congestion
      control algorithm to try to address these issues, and (3) validate your
      design.

      <li><b>Interpreting Learning-based Networking Systems</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      There is a growing interest in applying machine learning to solve networking problems
      (e.g., bit-rate adaption for video streaming, traffic engineering and
      congestion control). However, the blackbox nature of machine learning
      models makes network operators reluctant to use it. In this project, you
      will learn how to interpret the models of learning-based networking
      systems to explain their properties and behaviors in terms of logic rules.
      Your goal is to (1) understand the design of a learning-based networking
      system in depth and reproduce its results, (2) and implement 2-3
      interpretation methods to interpret the learning-based networking system
      you choose.
