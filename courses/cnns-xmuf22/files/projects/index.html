    <h2>Computer Networks and Network Security: Class Projects</h2>

    <p align="left">The following is a list of suggested project topics. Each
    team should consists of 2-4 students. This list will be updated with new
    topics as well as a short description in the next couple of weeks.
    <b>Please talk to the instructor to get the approval on team
    and project topic.</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Exploring Secure Multi-Party Computation</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Suppose you and your best friend each has a pile of money.  Neither
      of you wants to let the other person know how much money you
      have. How should you two find out who has more money so that he/she can
      pay for dinner? This is a thought experiment called the millionaire
      problem and one of the most representative secure multi-party computation
      (SMPC) problem. Many cryptography protocols have been proposed to solve
      different SMPC problems. In this project, you will learn about how to
      solve some SMPC problems on graphs. Your goal is to (1) learn about the
      basic knowledge of SMPC, (2) design and implement the solution of a SMPC
      problem on graphs (e.g., depth-first search), and (3) evaluate the
      security and performance of your algorithm analytically and
      experimentally.

      <li><b>Challenging Data Plane Verification</b>
      <br>
      <br>
	Data plane verification (DPV) checks the forwarding tables of routers to
	judge whether a network forwards packets correctly. Many DPV tools have
	been developed and open sourced, each claiming being the
	state-of-the-art at the time. Are they really as good as they claim? In
	this project, your goal is to (1) learn about the basics of DPV, (2) design a
	comprehensive benchmark to stress test DPV tools' performance, and (3)
	analyze the pros and cons of representative DPV tools based on your test
	results.

      <li><b>Capturing Causal-Relationship in Routing Protocols</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      In class, you have learnt that we can use execution traces to analyze the
      behaviors of reliable data transfer (RDT) protocols. RDT is a transport layer
      protocol that runs between a sender and a receiver. In fact, in network
      layer, we can also use execution traces to analyze routing protocols that
      run distributively among routers. In this project, you will learn how to
      do that by
      capturing the causal relationship among the route computation of different
      routers. Your goal is to (1) learn about the basic knowledge of two
      link-state routing protocols, OSPF and IS-IS, (2) learn how to set up a
      network of FRR software routers to run these two protocols, and (3) design
      and implement a plug-in of FRR to capture the causal relationship among
      routers that run these two protocols.

      <li><b>Accelerating Problem Solving Using Programmable Switches</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      You have all learnt about the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) in your
      discrete math class. SAT is a NP-complete problem, but modern SAT
      solvers have achieve some success in solving SAT problems efficiently.  
      In this project, you will learn how to use switches, devices
      people used to think can only be used to forward packets, to implement
      representative SAT solving algorithms and use them to solve SAT problems
      faster than modern SAT solvers that run on servers. Your goal is to (1) learn about the
      basic use of P4 programmable switches and the basic
      SAT algorithms, (2) design and implement an SAT solving algorithm on
      P4 switches, and (3) run benchmark to evaluate the performance of your
      implementation against the open-source Z3 solver.

      <li><b>Measurement Study of Congestion Control</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      In class, we teach the basics of congestion control algorithms and analyze
      their performances analytically. 
      In this project, you will learn how to use ns3, a state-of-the-art network
      simulator, to simulate different congestion control algorithms (e.g., TCP
      Reno and DCTCP) under different settings of topologies, traffic patterns
      and switch/router specifications. Your goal is to (1) conduct
      comprehensive measurement study to identify the issues of different
      congestion control algorithms, (2) design and implement your own congestion
      control algorithm to try to address these issues, and (3) validate your
      design.

      <li><b>Interpreting Learning-based Networking Systems</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      There is a growing interest in applying machine learning to solve networking problems
      (e.g., bit-rate adaption for video streaming, traffic engineering and
      congestion control). However, the blackbox nature of machine learning
      models makes network operators reluctant to use it. In this project, you
      will learn how to interpret the models of learning-based networking
      systems to explain their properties and behaviors in terms of logic rules.
      Your goal is to (1) understand the design of a learning-based networking
      system in depth and reproduce its results, (2) and implement 2-3
      interpretation methods to interpret the learning-based networking system
      you choose.
