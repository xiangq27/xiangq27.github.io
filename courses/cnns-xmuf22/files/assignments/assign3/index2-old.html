    <h2>CS433/533 Homework Assignment Three: Network Servers and Server Performance Evaluation (Part 2)</h2>

    <p>This assignment gives you a chance (Part 1) to better understand HTTP design, including its protocol and the processing at the server (Part 1). Another key goal of this assignment is give you a chance (Part 2) to become more familiar with concurrent network programming, covering topics including threads, synchronization, wait/notify (monitor), asynchronous I/O, and benchmarking.</p>

    <p>Due:
      <ul>
        <li>Part 2: 11:59 PM, Monday Oct. 23, 2017 (after October recess).
        <li>Competition: Among all valid servers. Bonus: 25% bonus and a small prize (A Rasberry Pi 3 Kit). 
      </ul>

<h3>Part 2a: Concurrent HTTP Servers using Threads</h3>

  <p>As we covered in class, a key approach to controlling the overhead of threads is to use a thread pool. We covered two designs: (1) shared welcome socket; and (2) a shared queue with wait and notitify. Please implement the following three threadpool servers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
        <p>thread pool with service threads competing on welcome socket;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>thread pool with a shared queue and busy wait;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>thread pool with a shared queue and suspension;</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

For each design, your server needs to read from the configuration file the pool size:

<pre>
ThreadPoolSize &lt;number of threads&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Part 2b: Async Server: Multiplexed, Nonblocking Server (Reactive Server)</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>We recommend that the software structure of your asynchronous 
      server be
      based on v3 of the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
      Courier, monospace; ">EchoServer</span> that we discussed in
      class. You need to write a handler for the particular
      protocol. You can feel free to modify the structure if you see
      any way to improve it (fix error handling, etc). You need to
      document your changes.</li><br>

      <li>The server should have a timeout thread. Upon
      accepting a new connection, the accept handler should register a
      timeout event with the timeout thread with a callback function.
      The timeout value is specified by <span style="font-family:
      'Courier New', Courier, monospace; ">IncompleteTimeout
      &lt;timeout in seconds&gt;</span>. The default timeout value is
      3 seconds. If the connection does not give a complete request to
      the server <em>approximately</em> within timeout from the time
      of being accepted, the server should disconnect the
      connection. Note that the timeout monitoring thread should not
      directly close a channel that the dispatcher thread is still
      monitoring (why?). You need to think very carefully about the
      exact details of the interaction between these two threads,
      propose a software design, and implement it.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Part 2c: Async Server: Proactive Server</h3>
    <p>In this part, instead of using the select structure, you use 
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.html">AsynchornousServerSocketChannel</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousSocketChannel.html">AsynchornousSocketChannel</a> design, based on Future/Listener to implement the same functionality as in 2b.

<h3>Part 2d: Comparison of Designs</h3>
    
    <p>A great way to learn about your design is to compare with other designs. You need to read the docuemnts or code of two related frameworks: xsocket and netty.</p>

    <h4>Part 2d(1): Comparison with xsocket</h4>
    <p>Although xsocket is no longer under active development, it provides a design alternative. Please read the source code and <a
    href="http://xsocket.sourceforge.net/documentation.htm">document</a>
    of <a href="http://xsocket.org/">x-Socket</a>, a high performance
    software library for reusable, asynchronous I/O servers. Please
    discuss in your report the following questions (please refer to
    the specific location when you refer to its document or source code:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How many dispatchers does x-Socket allow? If multiple, how
      do the dispatchers share workload?</li><br>

      <li>What is the basic flow of a dispatcher thread?</li><br>

      <li>What is the calling sequence until the <span
      style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
      ">onData</span> method of <span style="font-family: 'Courier
      New', Courier, monospace; ">EchoHandler</span> (see <span
      style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
      ">EchoHandler, EchoServer</span>, and <span style="font-family:
      'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">EchoServerTest</span>) is
      invoked?  Please check this link for testing code:
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/xsocket/code/HEAD/tree/xsocket/core/trunk/src/test/java/org/xsocket/connection/">http://sourceforge.net/p/xsocket/code/HEAD/tree/xsocket/core/trunk/src/test/java/org/xsocket/connection/</a></li><br>

      <li>How does x-Socket implement Idle timeout of a
      connection?</li><br>

      <li>Please give an example of how the library does testing (see
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/xsocket/code/HEAD/tree/xsocket/core/trunk/src/test/java/org/xsocket/connection/EchoServerTest.java">http://sourceforge.net/p/xsocket/code/HEAD/tree/xsocket/core/trunk/src/test/java/org/xsocket/connection/EchoServerTest.java</a>
      for an example).  Please describe how you may test your server
      with idle timeout?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Part 2d(2): Comparison with Netty</h4>
    <p>Netty is another Java async IO framework used by many; see <a href="http://netty.io/wiki/adopters.html">for example use cases</a>. Please read Netty <a href="http://netty.io/wiki/user-guide-for-5.x.html">user's guide</a> and answer the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
       <li>Netty provides multiple event loop implementations. In a typical server channel setting, <a href="http://netty.io/5.0/api/io/netty/bootstrap/ServerBootstrap.html#group(io.netty.channel.EventLoopGroup,%20io.netty.channel.EventLoopGroup)">two event loop groups are created</a>, with one typically called the boss group and the second worker group. What are they? How does Netty achieve synchronization among them?</li><br>

       <li>Method calls such as bind return ChannelFuture. Please describe how one may implement the sync method of a future.</li><br>

       <li>Instead of using ByteBuffer, Netty introduces a data structure called ByteBuf. Please give one key difference between ByteBuffer and ByteBuf.</li><br>

       <li>A major novel, interesting feature of Netty which we did not cover in class is ChannelPipeline. A pipeline may consist of a list of ChannelHander. Compare <a href="http://netty.io/4.0/xref/io/netty/example/http/helloworld/package-summary.html">HTTP Hello World Server</a> and <a href="http://netty.io/4.0/xref/io/netty/example/http/snoop/package-summary.html">HTTP Snoop Server</a>, what are the handlers that each includes?</li><br>

       <li>Please scan Netty implementation and give a high-level description of how ChannelPipeline is implemented.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 2e: Performance Benchmarking</h3> 

    <p>One important computer systems skill is to evaluate the
    performance of design alternatives. In this assignment, we conduct
    performance evaluation of the alternatives:

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p>To conduct the testing, you will need to setup the
        DocumentRoot at the server. It is highly recommended that you
        generate a number of files of different sizes under
        DocumentRoot named such as file1.html, file2.html, ...,
        file1000.html. If you download <a href="gen.tar">gen.tar</a>,
        and untar it (tar -xvf gen.tar), you will see a directory
        named doc-root and a directory named request-patterns.</p>

        <p>To compare the performance with Apache, we will use the
        department zoo Apache server. We will use
        /home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/web/www-root to store
        testing files. Suppose we want to fetch
        /home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/web/www-root/html-small/doc1.html. To
        use the department Apache server, since the department server
        has set DocumentRoot as /home/httpd/html/zoo, the URL should
        be:<br>
        http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs433/web/www-root/html-small/doc1.html
        
        <p>To use your server, suppose you set the DocumentRoot as
        /home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/web/www-root,
        and you run your server on cicada.cs.yale.edu at port 9876.
        Then the URL is:<br>
        http://cicada.cs.yale.edu:9876/html-small/doc1.html<br>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>For the test, you will need to generate a request file for the
        client. The request pattern can have a major impact on your
        server performance (how requests repeat). The TA will use a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto
          distribution</a> to generate request patterns to test your
        server. You can write a simple Java program or script to
        generate the request.
      </li><br>

      <li>You should vary the client parallel (see Client command line
        above) with a reasonable increment schedule (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4,
        5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, ...). A
        reasonable test time is 60 to 120 seconds. You can write a
        simple script to automate this task.
      </li><br>

      <li>For multi-threaded server, please try two thread pool sizes:
      one small and one large.</li>
      </ul>
  
  <h3>Part 2f: Report</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You should submit a report on your server design. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Please answer all questions we specified above.</li><br>

        <li>Please report the measured performance of both Apache and
        your best server for these performance metrics: throughput and
        (mean) delay. You can use open office or gnuplot to generate
        figures. Below is an example figure showing the performance of
        multiple servers.</li> <br>

        <li>The TA will benchmark all servers and pick
        the one with the highest throughput. This server will receive
        a bonus of 25%.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

      src="screenshot.jpg">

    <h3>Submission</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Please submit using canvas. Please include README
      to tell the TA the directory structure, e.g., which file is the
      report. Please generate a single jar file containing all of your
      files. </b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggestions</h3>

    <p align="left">During your async i/o design based on select, 
      think how you implement a finite state machine to handle each 
      request (e.g.,
    initial state after accepting a connection, what other states).
    Java async i/o does not allow you to select events on a file
    channel. There are can be multiple design options to handle file
    i/o:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Use standard file i/o by assuming that file system is
      fast and will not become bottleneck;</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>Try out mapped file i/o:
<pre>
FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(args[0]);
FileChannel in = fin.getChannel();
ByteBuffer input = in.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, in.size());
</pre></li>
         
      <li><p>Try out direct transfer: See FileChannel.transferTo;</p>

      <li><p>Use standard file i/o and use a thread pool to help with
      reading files.</p></li>
    </ul>
