    <h3>[Part 1: Coding; 70 points]</h3> 

    <p>Many network applications need a capability for two clients to
    ping each other to determine the round-trip time, loss rate, and
    bandwidth between them. For example, a Skype client A pings
    another Skype client B before deciding if A should use B as a
    relay. There are multiple tools available (e.g., <a
    href="http://www.speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a>), either on
    desktops or mobile devices, that provide such a functionality. In
    this part, you will implement a ping server and a corresponding
    client, using UDP programming.</p>

    <p>The ping protocol allows a client machine to send a sequence of
    packets of data to a remote machine, and have the remote machine
    return the data back to the client (an action referred to as
    echoing).  <p>You are given the starting code for the Ping server
    below. Your job is to write the Ping client and extend the Ping
    server. </p>

    <p><b>Server Code</b>:
    The following code is your starting code for a ping server. You
    should study this code carefully, as it will help you write your
    Ping client and extend the server code.</p>

    <pre>
    // PingServer.java
    import java.io.*;
    import java.net.*;
    import java.util.*;

    /* 
     * Server to process ping requests over UDP.
     */
        
    public class PingServer
    {
       private static final double LOSS_RATE = 0.3;
       private static final int AVERAGE_DELAY = 100; // milliseconds

       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
       {
          // Get command line argument.
          if (args.length != 1) {
             System.out.println("Required arguments: port");<br>
             return;
          }

          int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

          // Create random number generator for use in simulating
          // packet loss and network delay.
          Random random = new Random();

          // Create a datagram socket for receiving and sending
          // UDP packets through the port specified on the
          // command line.
          DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket(port);

          // Processing loop.
          while (true) {

             // Create a datagram packet to hold incomming UDP packet.
             DatagramPacket
                request = new DatagramPacket(new byte[1024], 1024);
      
             // Block until receives a UDP packet.
             socket.receive(request);
         
             // Print the received data, for debugging
             printData(request);

             // Decide whether to reply, or simulate packet loss.
             if (random.nextDouble() &lt; LOSS_RATE) {
                System.out.println(" Reply not sent.");
                continue;
             }

             // Simulate prorogation delay.
             Thread.sleep((int) (random.nextDouble() * 2 * AVERAGE_DELAY));

             // Send reply.
             InetAddress clientHost = request.getAddress();
             int clientPort = request.getPort();
             byte[] buf = request.getData();
             DatagramPacket
             reply = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, 
                                        clientHost, clientPort);
        
             socket.send(reply);
        
             System.out.println(" Reply sent.");
         } // end of while
       } // end of main

       /* 
        * Print ping data to the standard output stream.
        */
       private static void printData(DatagramPacket request) 
               throws Exception<br>
       {
          // Obtain references to the packet's array of bytes.
          byte[] buf = request.getData();

          // Wrap the bytes in a byte array input stream,
          // so that you can read the data as a stream of bytes.
          ByteArrayInputStream bais 
              = new ByteArrayInputStream(buf);

          // Wrap the byte array output stream in an input 
          // stream reader, so you can read the data as a
          // stream of **characters**: reader/writer handles 
          // characters
          InputStreamReader isr 
              = new InputStreamReader(bais);

          // Wrap the input stream reader in a bufferred reader,
          // so you can read the character data a line at a time.
          // (A line is a sequence of chars terminated by any 
          // combination of \r and \n.)
          BufferedReader br 
              = new BufferedReader(isr);

          // The message data is contained in a single line, 
          // so read this line.
          String line = br.readLine();

          // Print host address and data received from it.
          System.out.println("Received from " +         
            request.getAddress().getHostAddress() +
            ": " +
            new String(line) );
         } // end of printData
       } // end of class
    </pre>

    <p>The server sits in an infinite loop listening for incoming UDP
    packets. When a packet comes in, the example server simply sends
    the encapsulated data back to the client.</p>

    <p><b>Packet Loss and Delay</b>: UDP provides applications with an
    unreliable transport service, because messages may get lost in the
    network due to router queue overflows or other reasons. In
    contrast, TCP provides applications with a reliable transport
    service and takes care of any lost packets by retransmitting them
    until they are successfully received. Applications using UDP for
    communication must therefore implement any reliability they need
    separately in the application level (each application can
    implement a different policy, according to its specific
    needs).</p>


    <p>Because packet loss is rare or even non-existent in typical
    campus networks, the server in this assignment injects artificial
    losses to simulate the effects of network packet losses. The
    server has a parameter LOSS_RATE that determines which percentage
    of packets should be lost.</p>

    <p>The server also has another parameter AVERAGE_DELAY that is
    used to simulate the propagation delay. You should set
    AVERAGE_DELAY to a positive value when testing your client and
    server on the same machine, or when machines are close by on the
    network. You can set AVERAGE_DELAY to 0 to find out the true round
    trip times of your packets. </p>

    <p><b>Compiling and Running Server</b>: To
    compile the example server, do the following:
<pre> 
<font color="#a77c46">javac PingServer.java</font>
</pre></p>

    <p>To run the example server, do the following: 
<pre> 
<font color="#a77c46">java PingServer port</font>
</pre>
    where port is the port number the server listens on. Remember that
    you have to pick a port number greater than 1024, because only
    processes running with the root (administrator) privilege can bind
    to ports less than 1024. </p>


    <p>Note: if you get a class not found error when running the above
    command, then you may need to tell Java to look in the current
    directory in order to resolve class references. In this case, the
    commands will be as follows:
<pre>   
<font color="#a77c46">java -classpath . PingServer port</font>
</pre>


    <p>Now we specify your job.</p>

    <p><b>Message Format</b>:
    The ping messages from a client to the server in this assignment
      are formatted in the following way:
<pre>   
<font color="#a77c46">PING sequence_number client_send_time passwd CRLF</font>
</pre>

    where PING is the 4 ASCII characters, sequence_number is 2 bytes,
    and starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each successive ping message
    sent by the client; client_send_time is 8-byte local timestamp (in
    the format of Java currentTimeMill) encoding when the client sends
    the message; passwd is ASCII so that a server echoes only valid
    requests, and CRLF represents the carriage return and line feed
    characters that terminate the line. <br>
    <p>The reply from a server to a ping message is formatted in the
      following way:
<pre>   
<font color="#a77c46">PINGECHO sequence_number client_send_time passwd CRLF</font>
    </pre>
    where PINGECHO is the 8 ASCII characters, sequence_number,
    client_send_time, and passwd are echoes of client message.</p>


    <p>It is recommended that you read <a
    href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/0596007213">Chapter 4
    of Java Network Programming</a> on i/o issues.

    <p><b>Your Client</b>: You should write the client so that it
    sends 10 ping requests to the server, at a pace of one request per
    second (Hint: you can Use the Timer and TimerTask classes in
    java.util). After sending each request, the client waits up to one
    second to receive a reply. If one seconds goes by without a reply
    from the server, then the client assumes that either its request
    or the server's reply has been lost in the network. </p>

    <p>You should write the client so that it starts with the following
      command:
<pre>   
<font color="#a77c46">java PingClient host port passwd</font>
</pre>
    where host is the name of the computer that the server is running
    on and port is the port number that the server is listening
    to. Note that you can run the client and server either on
    different machines or on the same machine.</p>

    <p>The client should send 10 pings to the server. Because UDP is an
    unreliable protocol, some of the packets sent to the server may be
    lost, or some of the packets sent from server to client may be lost.
    For this reason, the client can not wait indefinitely for a reply to
    a ping message. You should have the client wait up to one second for
    a reply; if no reply is received, then the client should assume that
    the packet was lost during transmission across the network. You will
    need to research the API for DatagramSocket to find out how to set
    the timeout value on a datagram socket.</p>

    <p>The output of your client should report the minimum, maximum, and
    average RTTs. It should also report the loss rate.</p>

    <p>When developing your code, you may want to run the ping server
    on your machine, and test your client by sending packets to
    localhost (or, 127.0.0.1). After you have fully debugged your
    code, you should see how your application communicates across the
    network with a ping server run by another member of the class.</p>

    <p><b>Your Server</b>: Please modify the server program to check
    that the password is valid. The valid password should be provided
    when the server starts:

<pre>
<font color="#a77c46">java PingServer port passwd [-delay delay] [-loss loss]</font>
</pre>

  <h3>[Part 2: Design Questions; 30 points]</h3> 

    <ul>
    <li><b>[2a; 12pt]</b> Please discuss how you tested and validated your
    program in Part 1. In particular, please describe:<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>How did you handle encoding/decoding to make sure that
        your code works across platforms?</li><br>

        <li>How may you extend
        the program (client and server) to measure the bandwidth (from
        client to server, and reverse)? A reference is to use packet
        pair to estimate bandwidth: <a
        href="http://www.usenix.org/event/usits01/full_papers/lai/lai_html/">http://www.usenix.org/event/usits01/full_papers/lai/lai_html/</a>
        </li><br>

        <li>Is there any way you can extend the program to synchronize
        the clocks of the client and the server? What is the accuracy
        that you may get?
        </li>
      </ul><br>

    <li><b>[2b; 10pt]</b> We discussed in class briefly on the
    implementation of DNS using UDP. Please answer the following questions:<br><br>

      <ul>

        <li>We mentioned that each DNS packet includes an
        identification field to handle reply forwarding. One
        implementation is the following. Assume that a DNS server receives
        a DNS request R in UDP with src IP being h, src port being
        p, and identification being id. The server needs to generate a
        query to another server to answer R. Then the server (1) stores
        in a hash map so that id maps to (h, p), and (2) uses
        the identification field id specified in R for the new
        query. Does this work? Please justify your answer.</li><br>

        <li>Assume that a DNS server needs to wait for, on average,
        300 ms for the reply of its query that it forwarded. One
        concern is that the identification numbers may become
        exhausted when a new query that needs to be forwarded
        arrives. What is an expression to compute the exhausting
        likelihood?</li><br>

        <li>DNS servers depend heavily on caching to improve
        scalability. Given a DNS name a.b.c.d (e.g., mail.xmu.edu.cn) 
        that should be resolved. In what order should a DNS server search 
        its cache before querying other servers?</li>

      </ul><br>

    <li><b>[2c; 8pt]</b> DNS is a major security target. Please describe, briefly, a scheme, to take down a country's Internet access through an attack on DNS.

  </ul>

  <h3>[Part 3: (Bonus) Playing with Tool; 10 points]</h3> 

    <ul>

      <li><b>[3a]</b> DNS allows delegation of the name space
      hierarchy. Please use the dig tool to manually find out one sequence of
      name servers to resolve eecs.mit.edu to its IP
      address. Please capture the sequence of commands and outputs of
      using dig. In particular, please start with 
<pre> 
<font color="#a77c46">dig +norecurse @a.root-servers.net eecs.mit.edu A</font>
</pre>
      If multiple name servers are returned, please pick one and
      continue the manual process. One claims that MIT uses a server from
      another school as a backup of MIT's name servers. Is this true?</li><br>

      <li><b>[3b]</b> Please find 3 gmail servers (IP addresses). Please show the command outputs to support your answer.</li><br>

      <li><b>[3c]</b> Is a server with IP address 173.194.1.1 an authorized mail transfer agent for gmail? Please show the command outputs to support your answer.
    </ul>

 <h3>Submission</h3> 

    <p>Your submission
