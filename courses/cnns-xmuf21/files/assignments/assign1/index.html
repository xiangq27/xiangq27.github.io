    <ul>

      <li>[P1 (5 points)] Try to use traceroute and other tools to find:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>A destination host on the Internet so that
              the route from your laptop/desktop to the destination has 
              the largest number of hops that you can find. Please 
              list the hops. 
              What is your strategy to find such a host?</li>
          <li>A destination host on the Internet so that
              the route from your laptop/desktop to the destination 
              traverses the largest number of ISPs. You can get 
              full credit if it has at least 5 different ISPs, 
              but we encourage you to try to find a longer one.
              What is your strategy to find such a host?</li>
         </ol>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>[P2 (10 points)] Suppose the number of people at XMU is
      60000. Determine the number of external phone lines that XMU
      will need in order to achieve a call blocking percentage of 1%.
      Assume that each person at XMU makes one external phone call
      per day, and each such phone call lasts on average 3 minutes,
      with the memoryless distribution.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>[P3 (10 points)] Suppose that you are designing a Web server for your
      startup. You have acquired a single machine with a quad-core
      processor. Assume that CPU is the bottleneck. You anticipate
      that Web requests arrive (memoryless) at a rate of 15
      requests/second, and benchmarking shows that it takes a core on
      average 200 ms to serve a Web request. What is the average
      service time that each Web request experiences? If it is a
      dual-core processor, what happens? You need to draw the state
      diagram when working on this problem.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

     <li>[P4 (5 points)] This elementary problem explores propagation delay and
     transmission delay, two central concepts in data
     networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single
     link of rate <i>R</i> bps. Suppose that the two hosts are
     separated by <i>m</i> meters, and suppose the propagation speed
     along the link is <i>s</i> meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet
     of size <i>L</i> bits to Host B.<br><br>

       <ol type="a">
           <li>Express the propagation delay, <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>,
           in terms of <i>m</i> and <i>s</i>.</li>

           <li>Determine the transmission time of the packet,
           <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>, in terms of <i>L</i> and
           <i>R</i>.</li>

           <li>Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an
           expression for the end-to-end delay.</li>

           <li>Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time
           <i>t</i> = 0. At time <i>t</i> = <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>,
           where is the last bit of the packet?</li>

           <li>Suppose <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub> is greater than
           <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>. At time <i>t</i> =
           <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>, where is the first bit of the
           packet?</li>

           <li>Suppose <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub> is less than
           <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>. At time <i>t</i> =
           <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>, where is the first bit of the
           packet?</li>

           <li>Suppose <i>s</i> = 2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup>, <i>L</i> = 120
           bits, and <i>R</i> = 56 kbps. Find the distance <i>m</i> so
           that <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub> equals
           <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>.</li>

        </ol>
        <br>
      </li>

      <li>[P5 (10 points)] Suppose two hosts, A and B, are separated by 20,000
      kilometers and are connected by a direct link of <i>R</i> = 2
      Mbps. Suppose the propagation speed over the link is 2.5
      &#x000B7; 10<sup>8</sup> meters/sec.

        <ol type="a">

          <li>Calculate the bandwidth-delay product, <i>R</i>
          &#x000B7; <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>.</li>

          <li>Consider sending a file of 800,000 bits from Host A to
          Host B. Suppose the file is sent continuously as one large
          message. What is the maximum number of bits that will be in
          the link at any given time?</li>

          <li>Provide an interpretation of the bandwidth-delay
          product.</li>

          <li>What is the width (in meters) of a bit in the link? Is
          it longer than a football field?</li>

          <li>Derive a general expression for the width of a bit in
          terms of the propagation speed <i>s,</i> the transmission
          rate <i>R,</i> and the length of the link <i>m</i>.</li>

        </ol>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>[P6 (10 points)] In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice
      from Host A to Host B over a packet-switched network
      (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a digital 64 kbps bit
      stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte
      packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its
      transmission rate is 2 Mbps and its propagation delay is 10
      msec. As soon as Host A gathers a packet, it sends it to Host
      B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it converts the
      packet&#x02019;s bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses
      from the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal
      at Host A) until the bit is decoded (as part of the analog
      signal at Host B)?  <br><br>
      </li>

     <li>[P7 (5 points)] Suppose you would like to urgently deliver 40 terabytes
     data from Boston to Los Angeles. You have available a 100 Mbps
     dedicated link for data transfer. Would you prefer to transmit
     the data via this link or instead use FedEx over-night delivery? 
     Explain.<br><br>
     </li>

     <li>[P8 (10 points)] Consider an application that transmits data at a steady
     rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data
     every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such
     an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively
     long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly
     justifying your answer:<br><br>

       <ol type="a">
         <li>Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched
         network be more appropriate for this application? Why?<br><br>

         <li>Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the
         only traffic in this network comes from such applications as
         described above. Furthermore, assume that the sum of the
         application data rates is less than the capacities of each
         and every link. Is some form of congestion control needed? 
         Why?
       </ol>
       <br>
     </li>

      <li>[P9 (10 points)] Suppose users share a 3 Mbps link. Also suppose each
      user requires 150 kbps when transmitting, but each user
      transmits only 10 percent of the time. (You can refer to the
      discussion of packet switching versus circuit switching in
      Section 1.3.2. of the textbook, if you want.)

        <ol type="a">

          <li>When circuit switching is used, how many users can be
          supported?</li>

          <li>For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet
          switching is used. You can use either our queueing analysis in class
          or direct binomial distribution analysis.
          Find the probability that a given user is
          transmitting.</li>

          <li>Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that
          at any given time, exactly <i>n</i> users are transmitting
          simultaneously.</li>

          <li>Find the probability that there are 21 or more users
          transmitting simultaneously.</li>
        </ol>
      <br>
      </li>

     <li>[P10 (10 points)] In modern packet-switched networks, including the
     Internet, the source host segments long, application-layer
     messages (for example, an image or a music file) into smaller
     packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiver then
     reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer
     to this process as <i>message</i> <i>segmentation</i>. The figure
     below illustrates the end-to-end transport of a message with and
     without message segmentation. Consider a message that is
     8x10<sup>6</sup> bits long that is to be sent from source to
     destination in the figure below. Suppose each link in the figure
     is 2 Mbps. Ignore propagation, queuing, and processing delays.

        <ol type="a">

         <li>Consider sending the message from source to destination
         <i>without</i> message segmentation. How long does it take to
         move the message from the source host to the first packet
         switch? Keeping in mind that each switch uses
         store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to
         move the message from source host to destination host?</li>

         <li>Now suppose that the message is segmented into 800
         packets, with each packet being 10,000 bits long. How long
         does it take to move the first packet from source host to the
         first switch? When the first packet is being sent from the
         first switch to the second switch, the second packet is being
         sent from the source host to the first switch. At what time
         will the second packet be fully received at the first
         switch?</li>

         <li>How long does it take to move the file from source host
         to destination host when message segmentation is used? 
         Compare this result with your answer in part (a) and
         comment.</li>

         <li>In addition to reducing delay, what are reasons to use
         message segmentation?</li>

         <li>Discuss the drawbacks of message segmentation.</li>

      <li>[P11 (10 points)] Consider sending a large file of <i>F</i> bits from
      Host A to Host B. There are three links (and two switches)
      between A and B, and the links are uncongested (that is, no
      queuing delays). Host A segments the file into segments of
      <i>S</i> bits each and adds 80 bits of header to each segment,
      forming packets of <i>L</i> = 80 + <i>S</i> bits. Each link has
      a transmission rate of <i>R</i> bps. Find the value of <i>S</i>
      that minimizes the delay of moving the file from Host A to Host
      B. Disregard propagation delay.  <br><br>

      <li>[P12 (5 points)] Skype is a software that allows 
      you to make a phone
      call from a PC to an ordinary phone. This means that the voice
      call must pass through both the Internet and through a telephone
      network. Discuss how this might be done.<br><br>
