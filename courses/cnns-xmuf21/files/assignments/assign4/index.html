  <h2>CS433/533 Assignment 4: Reliable Transport and Congestion Control</h2>

    <p>Your assignment is to design and implement a protocol for
    reliable transport and congestion control, that is, a simplified
    version of TCP. This assignment consists of two perspectives:
    reliability and congestion control. We give out the two
    perspectives at the same time so that you can better organize
    your design.</p>

    <h3 align="left">General Introduction to Fishnet</h3>
    <p align="left">For this assignment, we will usw the "Fishnet"
      software project infrastructure. Here is some general introduction
      to Fishnet:</p>

    </ul>

    <h3 align="left">Fishnet with link model</h3>
    <p align="left">The original Fishnet distribution has limited
      simulation/emulation of buffering and loss characteristics of
      physical links. In simulation mode, only loss is simulated, and a
      link effectively has infinite buffer space. In emulation mode,
      there is no emulated buffering and loss. Therefore, if you run the
      emulation on zoo machines, you will almost experience no loss of
      packets. In order to help you stress test your implementation, we
      have modified Fishnet to provide simulation/emulation of buffering
      and loss characteristics of physical links. Please use the links
      above to download the new code distribution and API documentation.</p>
    <p align="left">The following is a summary of changes we have made
      to Fishnet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The unit used in the "edge" command to specify bandwidth has
        been changed to "B/s", instead of "KB/s". The default value is
        still 10KB/s. Please update the "edge" command "bw" options in
        your topology file if there are any. If you notice that your TCP
        throughput drops dramatically after switching to the new
        Fishnet, please check if you have updated your "bw" options in
        the "edge" commands.</li>
      <li> The "edge" command now supports an additional option "bt",
        which specifies the buffering capacity of the edge, in terms of
        buffering time in milliseconds. For example, suppose the
        bandwidth of an edge is 10KB/s, "bt 100" means the edge can
        buffer 100 milliseconds of data sent at 10KB/s, i.e., 1000
        bytes. The default buffering capacity is 250 milliseconds.</li>
      <li>The simulator now takes buffering capacity into account, and
        will drop packets when buffer overflows.</li>
      <li>The emulator now emulates both buffering and loss.</li>
      <li>The simulator/emulator will, on exit, print out statistics
        about dropped packets (due to buffer overflow) and lost packets
        (due to loss).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="style2"> Part 1: Reliable Transport</h3>
    <p>Your job is to design and implement a transport protocol with the
      following features. For transport packets, use the TRANSPORT_PKT
      protocol. The packet payload should be a packed object of class
      Transport. </p>
    <p><b>Connection setup/teardown:</b> A connection is identified by a
      four-tuple, the combination of a source and destination fishnet
      address plus a source and destination port value. Our connection
      state machine is considerably simpler than the one described for
      TCP. Specifically: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, connections are one-way byte streams, not two-way as in
        TCP. (Of course, you can easily build two-way byte streams on
        top of two one-way byte streams.) </li>
      <li>Second, we assume a simpler hand-shake mechanism. As with TCP,
        each connection should be established before data is transferred
        and torn down after all data has been transferred. The sender
        initially sends a connection request to the receiver, by picking
        an initial sequence number and setting the SYN flag. The
        receiver then replies with an acknowledgment packet (with the
        ACK flag set). The transfer can then proceed. </li>
      <li>Teardown is also simple -- either side closes the connection
        by sending a packet with the FIN flag set. FIN should also be
        used to indicate "connection refused" when there is no
        application awaiting connections on the destination port. </li>
      <li>Unlike in TCP, packets with the SYN, ACK, or FIN flag never
        carry payload data. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must support multiple, concurrent connections. We suggest
      that you define your own transport connection structure, with your
      node having an array of such structures, one per connection in
      use. The structure will encode all state associated with a
      connection, including sequence numbers, buffered data (both sent
      awaiting acknowledgment and possible retransmission, and received
      awaiting processing by the application), and connection state
      (such as established, the SYN has been sent but not acknowledged,
      etc.). </p>
    <p><b>Reliability and Sliding Window:</b> Each payload packet should
      be transmitted reliably by using sequence/acknowledgment number
      field and timeouts and retransmissions. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The sequence number advances in terms of bytes of data that
        are sent. </li>
      <li>The acknowledgement number operates as in TCP to give the next
        expected in-order sequence number, and an acknowledgement should
        be sent every time that a data packet is received. That is, the
        acknowledgement number does not increase when a packet has been
        lost until that packet has been retransmitted and received.
        (Note that since an ACK never carries data, we put the
        acknowledgment number in the Transport header sequence number
        field.) </li>
      <li>Note that packets carry both a sequence number in the packet
        header (which is unique among all packets sent by this node),
        and a sequence number in every transport header (which is the
        place within the byte stream for this data or ACK packet). These
        two roles for sequence number are semantically distinct, and in
        fact, the IP header has its own unique identifier field separate
        from the sequence number in TCP's header. </li>
      <li><i>We recommend that you first implement a "stop and wait"
          style scheme, where only a single packet can be outstanding at
          a time. Once that is working, implement a fixed-size sliding
          window. </i> </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p> As usual, you should strive to come up with a design that will
      inter-operate with other students' nodes. As you do, take the
      following steps: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement the Fishnet socket APIs defined in the provided
        code. To help you test your implementation, the code implements,
        using these APIs, a transfer client and a transfer server. The
        transfer client sets up a connection to a transfer server, sends
        a test pattern to the server, and tears down the connection upon
        completion. The transfer server will check that the test pattern
        is expected. A "transfer" command and a "server" command are
        implemented by a node to start a client and a server,
        respectively. You're free to build more test cases to verify
        your implementation of the socket APIs.
        <ul>
          <li>The APIs are defined in Java classes TCPSock (in
            TCPSock.java) and TCPManager (in TCPManager.java). Class
            TCPSock defines an API that handles operations on a single
            socket, such as read/write and close. Class TCPManager
            defines a single function - "socket()" - that creates a new
            socket, and is supposed to handle connection management
            and/or any book-keeping that involves more than one socket.</li>
          <li>During your implementation, it might be helpful to take a
            look at the code for the transfer client and server, to
            better understand the semantics of the APIs. The code for
            the transfer client is in "TransferClient.java", and the
            code for the server is in "TransferServer.java".</li>
          <li><i>NOTE: All of the socket APIs must be non-blocking.</i>
            For example, if a call of "TCPSock.write" cannot write all
            of the data (or even no data at all!) due to some reasons,
            the call should write whatever it can at the current moment,
            and return with the number of bytes successfully written.
            This is due to the fact that Fishnet is an event-driven
            simulator/emulator; thus if a call blocks, it also blocks
            the whole simulator/emulator. Again, it may be helpful to
            take a look at the code for the transfer client and server,
            which are also implemented in a event-driven fashion.</li>
          <li>The four APIs that query the state of a socket are simple
            enough that their implementation is already provided. They
            should work fine, and you may not need to modify them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>At the sender and receiver, print the following single letter
        codes, without a newline, when a packet of the appropriate type
        is sent or received:
        <ul>
          <li>"S" for a SYN packet </li>
          <li>"F" for a FIN packet </li>
          <li>"." for a regular data packet </li>
          <li>"!" for a retransmission at the sender or duplicate at the
            receiver </li>
          <li>":" for an acknowledgement packet that advances the
            acknowledgement field </li>
          <li>"?" for an acknowledgement packet that does not advance
            the field </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These codes will give you visual feedback to help you gauge
          the progress of a transfer and give us a trace for your
          turnin. If you print the codes as specified above, a
          successful connection will appear as a sequence of mostly dot
          characters marching across your screen. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Run your Fishnet with a relatively high level of packet loss
        (5%, say) to check that lost data is successfully retransmitted.
        Packet loss on a given link can be specified in the topology
        file provided to the simulator (for example: edge 0 1 lossRate
        0.05 delay 5 bw 10) to establish a link between node 0 and 1,
        with a 5% loss rate, 10KB/s bandwidth, and 5 millisecond
        propagation delay. You can also generate sample topologies using
        topogen's "-l" flag.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="style3">Part 2: Flow Control and Congestion Control</h3>
    <p><strong>Requirements</strong>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Flow Control</em>: Your protocol should use the advertised
        window field along with the sequence and acknowledgment numbers
        to implement flow control so that a fast sender will not
        overwhelm a slow receiver. The advertised window field tells the
        other end how much buffer space is available to hold data that
        has not yet been consumed by the application. </li>
      <li><em>Congestion Control</em>: Design and implement AIMD
        congestion control. In addition, you will need to design some
        test cases to illustrate the behavior of your design. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Running Your Nodes in Fishnet</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to run your nodes: in the simulator (the
      'simulate' mode) or in the emulator (the 'emulate' mode). Suppose
      your have implemented your "transfer" command with syntax
      "transfer addr port", where "addr" is the address of the receiver,
      and "port" is the port the receiver is listening to. The following
      shows two examples of potentially how to set up the Fishnet
      environment to run your nodes.</p>
    <p>If you use the trawler, here is a topology file that contains
      only two connected node: <a href="two.topo">two.topo</a>. You can
      use this file when you run the trawler. Specifically, do the
      following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open three new terminals</li>
      <li>In terminal 1, type: perl trawler.pl 8888 two.topo</li>
      <li>In terminal 2, type: perl fishnet.pl emulate localhost 8888
        10000. You should see a line like the following, which tells you
        that this node has the address 0: Node 0 started</li>
      <li>In terminal 3, type: perl fishnet.pl emulate localhost 8888
        10001. You should see a line like the following, which tells you
        that this node has the address 1: Node 1 started</li>
      <li>You can then proceed to test your nodes. For example, if node
        0 listens on port 21 with backlog of 2, type "server 21 2" in
        terminal 2; to transfer 50000 bytes from node 1 port 40 to node
        0 port 21, type "transfer 0 21 40 50000" in terminal 3.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you use the simulator, there is a sample test script
      "transfertest.fish" under the "scripts" directory. You can run it
      using the command "perl fishnet.pl simulate 2
      scripts/transfertest.fish". If you would like to know more details
      about the built-in commands and their syntax, please refer to the
      documentation at the beginning of CommandsParser.java. </p>
    <h4>FAQ</h4>
    <p>Here are some frequently asked questions and answers for this
      assignment:</p>
    <p>Q: Are all source and destination ports always 1, or are they
      variable and must be specified in the various commands that you
      implement?</p>
    <p>A: You should support arbitrary port numbers. Please note that
      the "transfer" command example outlined in the preceding
      description is only a test scenario suggested for you to test your
      design.</p>
    <p>Q:&nbsp;Are we supposed to support multiple concurrent
      connections between the same 2 nodes in the same 1-way direction?</p>
    <p>A: Yes.</p>
    <p>Q: Must a server be listening first before a client can connect
      to it? Do we need a separate command to setup a server?</p>
    <p>A: Yes, a server must be listening on a port before a client can
      connect to it. However, a separate command to setup a server is
      not strictly required. You may arrange your server to listen on a
      default port number. However, you're encouraged to implement such
      a command. Please clearly document your design decision when you
      submit your assignment.</p>
    <p>Q: Should timeout values be constant or variable?</p>
    <p>A: Timeout values should be variable. Please refer to the lecture
      slides for how to determine timeout values.</p>
    <p>Q: Do we have to implement slow start?</p>
    <p>A: No, slow start is optional.</p>
    <p>Q: Should the sender and the reciever both print a packet in their trace</p>
    <p>A: Yes.</p>
    <h4>Submission<br>
    </h4>
    <p>Please submit using classv2 server. Turn in electronic and paper
      material as follows. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run a two-node fishnet emulation. Perform a reliable transfer
        of at least 100 packets. Capture the output (from both the
        sending node and the receiving node) and mark it up to tell us
        what is going on. (It's fine if the output includes only your
        commands and the "SF.!:?" characters as described above.) </li>
      <li>You submission should include:
        <ul>
          <li>A brief design document.</li>
          <li>A document containing any output we have asked you to
            capture. </li>
          <li>Short answers to the discussion questions below: Diss1a,
            Diss1b, and Diss1c for the first submission; Diss2 for the
            second submission. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
    <ol>

      <li><i>Diss1a</i>: Your transport protocol implementation picks
      an initial sequence number when establishing a new
      connection. This might be 1, or it could be a random
      value. Which is better, and why? </li>

      <li><i>Diss1b</i>: Our connection setup
        protocol is vulnerable to the following attack. The attacker
        sends a large number of connection request (SYN) packets to a
        particular node, but never sends any data. (This is called a SYN
        flood.) What happens to your implementation if it were attacked
        in this way? How might you have designed the initial handshake
        protocol (or the protocol implementation) differently to be more
        robust to this attack? </li>

      <li><i>Diss1c</i>: What happens in your
        implementation when a sender transfers data but never closes a
        connection? (This is called a FIN attack.) How might we design
        the protocol differently to better handle this case? </li>

      <li><i>Diss2</i>: Your transport protocol
        implementation picks the size of a buffer for received data that
        is used as part of flow control. How large should this buffer
        be, and why? </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Grading guidelines</h4>
    <p>Each part of the project is graded on a 5 point (0-4) scale,
      multiplied by the weight of the part. The weighted grades from all
      parts of the project are added together to produce the final
      grade. There is an extra credit component to this project. </p>
    <p>The five point scale is based on how well you show your
      understanding of the problem, and in case of code how well your
      implementation works: </p>
    <p>0 - nothing turned in<br>
      1 - show minimal understanding of the problem / most things don't
      work<br>
      2 - show some understanding of the problem / some things work<br>
      3 - show a pretty good understanding of the problem / most things
      work<br>
      4 - show excellent understanding of the problem / everything works<br>
    </p>
    <p>The weights for the parts are: </p>
    <p>Transport layer implementation: 1/2 of total grade<br>
      Write-up of your design decisions: 1/4 of total grade<br>
      Answers to discussion questions: 1/8 of total grade<br>
